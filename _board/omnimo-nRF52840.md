## Qwiic and Pmod-friendly

Omnimo nRF52840 is equipped with a JST 4-position 1mm connector linked to the I2C port, also known as [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) or [Stemma QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt). With over 300 compatible modules available on the market, you can quickly connect one or more of them to the board in series. Additionally, you can use dozens of [Grove](https://www.seeedstudio.com/category/Grove-c-1003.html) modules through this connector with an adapter cable (e.g. [PRT-15109](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15109)).

[Digilent Pmods](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/start) can also be connected directly to Omnimo nRF52840, allowing you to benefit from a wide range of available modules.

## Accessibility Maintained
Omnimo’s LEDs and switches are thoughtfully positioned to remain accessible regardless of which add-on boards are used. It also includes a dedicated on/off switch, so you don’t need to unplug the USB cable or battery to power down the board. Furthermore, the battery can be recharged even while the board is turned off.


## Develop Your Application with Ease

The board comes preloaded with the UF2 bootloader, allowing you to develop programs for the board using Arduino IDE or CircuitPython and load compiled code via USB serial or by dragging and dropping firmware files using the mass storage interface. If you prefer, you can also use the over-the-air (OTA) programming capability.


Advanced programming and debugging is possible through the SWD port (standard 2x5 1.27 mm connector), allowing you to take advantage of many features of the Nordic nRF Connect SDK to build your project.

## Optimized for Home Assistant


Omnimo nRF52840 is perfect for Home Assistant due to its support for multiple protocols and extensive compatibility with add-on boards, particularly those equipped with sensors. Its low power consumption allows for long-term battery-powered operation, where wall power can't reach.
